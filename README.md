# Summer Lecture List

* Optimization
  * Overview: A brief overview of stochastic gradient descent and then an in depth look at variance reduction optimization and the theoretical and practical convergence rate increase
* Back Propogation Algorithm
  * One of the fundamental algorithm that deep learning is based on. BP is a specific algorithm for computing the gradient of a neural network
* General Adversial Networks
  * Overview: Similar to variational inference, GAN attempt to approximate an intractable probability distribution through a learning process of a game between two adversaries
* Long Short Term Memory Algorithm
  * A famous recurrent neural network algorithm
* Mathematical Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
  * Learning without separation between training and testing. Instant feedback
* Radamacher Complexity
  * Radamacher compexity is a function class measure that gives tighter theoretical bounds on the generalization error of binary margin learners
* Natajaran Dimension
  * An extension of VC dimension to the multiclass classification setting
* Computational Complexity of Learning
  * PAC learner hypothesis classes have a restriction of the big-O runtime of the learning algorithm
